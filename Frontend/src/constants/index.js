        Maze solving is a classical problem in computer science and artificial intelligence, often used to demonstrate algorithmic problem-solving and pathfinding techniques. This report explores various algorithms used to solve mazes, with a focus on their effectiveness in finding the optimal path from a start to a goal position while avoiding obstacles. The report covers three major algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* search algorithm, each of which has distinct advantages and limitations. BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted maze but is memory-intensive. DFS, while less resource-demanding, does not necessarily find the shortest path, as it explores paths deeply before backtracking. A* combines the efficiency of BFS with a heuristic that estimates the cost to reach the goal, optimizing both time and space complexity.
    The report includes a detailed analysis of the algorithms' performance, providing implementation examples, pseudocode, and visualizations of maze-solving processes. A comparison of time complexity, space complexity, and optimality is also presented, demonstrating the trade-offs between the algorithms. Finally, the report discusses practical applications of maze-solving algorithms in fields such as robotics, gaming, and puzzle-solving, and suggests areas for future research and improvements in algorithmic efficiency.
